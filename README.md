# The Herron Temperature Scale

The Herron (H) temperature scale is a practical temperature system with two intuitive reference points:

- **0 H** = Freezing point of water (32°F / 0°C)
- **100 H** = Human body temperature (98.7°F / 37°C)

Very simple and straightforward, and it wasn't exactly a lot of work to create. Although, as far as I can tell no one has ever proposed this system before (at least, I can't find it anywhere). So, this document is my proposal. I do think it's superior for everyday use, and if nothing else it's an interesting alternative. 

I'm calling it the Herron scale only because every major temperature system seems to have taken the surname of its inventor. If you have a better name idea, I'm open to anything that would increase the likelihood of adoption.

PS: Nothing will increase the likelihood of adoption.

I'm surprised you're reading this.

## Conversion Formulas

### Fahrenheit ⟷ Herron
- **F to H:** H = 3/2 × (F - 32)
- **H to F:** F = (2/3 × H) + 32

### Celsius ⟷ Herron
- **C to H:** H = 27/10 × C
- **H to C:** C = 10/27 × H

## Degree Intervals

- **1°H = 0.667°F** (or 2/3°F)
- **1°F = 1.5°H** (or 3/2°H)
- **1°H = 0.370°C** (or 10/27°C)
- **1°C = 2.7°H** (or 27/10°H)

The scale is linear so ratios are constant across the entire range - a 10-degree change in Herron always equals a 6.67-degree change in Fahrenheit or a 3.7-degree change in Celsius, regardless of the starting temperature.

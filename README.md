# The Herron Temperature Scale

The Herron (H) temperature scale is a practical temperature system with two intuitive reference points:

- **0 H** = Freezing point of water (32°F / 0°C)
- **100 H** = Human body temperature (98.7°F / 37°C)

Very simple and straightforward, and it wasn't exactly a lot of work to create. However, as far as I can tell no one has ever proposed this system before (at least, I can't find it anywhere). So then, this document is my proposal. I do think it's superior for everyday use, and if nothing else it's an interesting alternative.

I'm calling this the Herron scale only because every major temperature system seems to have taken the surname of its inventor. If you have a better name idea, I'm open to anything that would increase the likelihood of adoption.

PS: Nothing will increase the likelihood of adoption.

I'm surprised you're even reading this.

## Conversion Formulas

### Fahrenheit ⟷ Herron
- **F to H:** H = 3/2 × (F - 32)
- **H to F:** F = (2/3 × H) + 32

### Celsius ⟷ Herron
- **C to H:** H = 27/10 × C
- **H to C:** C = 10/27 × H

## Degree Intervals

- **1°H = 0.667°F** (or 2/3°F)
- **1°F = 1.5°H** (or 3/2°H)
- **1°H = 0.370°C** (or 10/27°C)
- **1°C = 2.7°H** (or 27/10°H)
